# Purpose

Calling function constructors with an array of arguments is difficult.

For a given function constructor
```js
function Student(firstName, lastName, birthYear){
	this.firstName = firstName
	this.lastName = lastName
	this.birthYear = birthYear
}
```

We want to easily call the function constructor like

```js
var arr = ['john','scot', 1980]
var s = new Student(arr) //but this will obviously not work
```

NEWIFY to the rescue!

```js
var arr = ['john','scot', 1980]
var s = require('newify')(Student, arr)
```

# Installation

```
npm install newify
```

# Usage

As in the above example, just give `newify` a function and an array of args

```js
var arr = ['john','scot', 1980]
var s = require('newify')(Student, arr)
```
